# RainFall

Run the file RainFallUI

// Application is being divided into components so it could be unit test (means unit test should be return)

Upload both file device and data file

Data is not being stored in data base but it could be easily stored into the data base by extending the datamodel class

Note:
due to stuck with CSV Parser not sure it not properly parse at first few time due to window access and data issue(?) 
but it work now.

only thing is left the color and display part 
and unit test could be added.
