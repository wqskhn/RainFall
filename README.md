# RainFall
    Execute the RainFallUI file to initiate the application.

    The application is being modularized into components to facilitate unit testing.

    Please upload both the device and data files.

    While the data is not currently stored in a database, it can be easily achieved by extending the data model class.

Note: While dealing with the CSV parser, initial parsing issues might have arisen due to Windows access and data-related problems (?). However, the issue has been resolved, and it is now functioning properly.

The pending tasks include implementing the color and display functionalities. Additionally, there is room for adding unit tests.
